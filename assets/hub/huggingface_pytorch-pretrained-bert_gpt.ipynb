    "### Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "GPT was released together with the paper [Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/openai-assets/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf) by Alec Radford et al at OpenAI. It's a combination of two ideas: Transformer model and large scale unsupervised pre-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are three models based on [OpenAI's pre-trained weights](https://github.com/openai/finetune-transformer-lm) along with the associated Tokenizer.\n",
    "It includes:\n",
    "- `openAIGPTModel`: raw OpenAI GPT Transformer model (fully pre-trained)\n",
    "- `openAIGPTLMHeadModel`: OpenAI GPT Transformer with the tied language modeling head on top (fully pre-trained)\n",
    "- `openAIGPTDoubleHeadsModel`: OpenAI GPT Transformer with the tied language modeling head and a multiple choice classification head on top (OpenAI GPT Transformer is pre-trained, the multiple choice classification head is only initialized and has to be trained)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike most other PyTorch Hub models, GPT requires a few additional Python packages to be installed."
